        <h1>Working life</h1>
        <p>During my working life I've had several jobs, I've worked in a factory as a QA and a stand in team leader of which i had this position for 10 months before leaving. I then worked at Mcdonalds for 3 years and even becoming a trainee shift manager in the process. I then moved onto the position I have now, a street care operative for the Hull City council. In all my jobs communication has been key with the public and with my colleagues. I have an extremely strong work ethic and have great time keeping skills. I can work well as part of a team and alone also if I have to. I have a disciplined attitude and great interpersonal skills. I work extremely well under pressure and strive for perfection at every oppurtunity.</p>

            <h1>Personal life</h1>
            <p>I have a little family with my girlfriend and my daughter who mean the world to me. I am a bit of a nerd/geek (if the little snippets were not enough to go on). I love watching football and rugby league in my free time. I've loved tech and ever since being a child, I've loved knowing how things worked whether its a rocket ship or a website I love to learn whats behind the thing we all see. With that in mind and drive due to wanting a career change I've decided to push myself towards web development. At the time of writing this I only know HTML and CSS, however I'm thoroughly enjoying the work I'm doing. Thats what it's all about right?</p>
